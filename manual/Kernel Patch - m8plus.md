# Kernel Patch - m8plus

Start by placing the IPS patch inside of an empty folder with the M8plus BIOS. (The BIOS release pictured below also included a separate BIOS for 1.0-1.5 and another for 1.6)

Open EVtool and click ‘Unpack’, then choose your BIOS for the system you’re patching. (M8plus.bin for 1.0 - 1.5 systems and M8plus_16.bin for 1.6 systems)

At this point, you should have an m8plus_kernel.img file in the same folder has the BIOS.
