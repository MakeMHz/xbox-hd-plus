# Identifying Xbox Revision
This guide will step you through 100% identifying the Xbox revision you have.

While other guides may focus on identifying Xbox revisions by the serial number, manufacture date, DVD drive, or some other combo; these methods are not perfect.

## Partial Disassembly
iFixit has a great disassembly guide located [here](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Xbox+Disassembly/1308). It should only be necessary to follow up to around step 7.

## Identifying Revision
Following the reference image below you can quickly and easily identify your Xbox revision.

### Power Connector
- If the power connector is a single row, like the one pictured, the system is a **1.0/1.1** revision.
- If the power connector is a dual row then the encoder will need to be checked.

### Encoder
- If the encoder is a Conexant or Focus then the system is a **1.2 - 1.5** revision (dual row power connector).
- If the encoder is marked Xcalibur then the system is a **1.6** revision.
